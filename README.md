# ChooseYourOwnCards
Have you ever felt that you have too many choices? Well, now here's a brand new choice that you can make that allows you to get rid of choices!

Introducing: Choose Your Own Cards!

With Choose Your Own Cards, you can blacklist as many cards from your runs as you'd like! Don't over do it though, you still need to pick at least 6 cards to make it to the end of a standard run.

In the pause menu, you should be able to find a new option - CYOC! Once you enter into the CYOC submenu, you will be able to navigate all the cards in the game with the up/down arrow keys, left arrow to enable/disable a card, and right arrow to jump to a new card-type section.
