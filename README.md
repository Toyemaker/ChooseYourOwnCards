# ChooseYourOwnCards
Have you ever felt that you have too many choices? Well, now here's a brand new choice that you can make that allows you to get rid of choices!

Introducing: Choose Your Own Cards!

With Choose Your Own Cards, you can blacklist as many cards from your runs as you'd like! Don't over do it though, you still need to pick at least 6 cards to make it to the end of a standard run.

Simply press F1 to open the mod menu, find the configs for Choose Your Own Cards, and blamo! You now have the ability to pick and choose which cards you'd like to disable! (All cards are enabled by default.)
